# Why Julia?

## _(Do we really need another language?)_

???

Multiple dispatch

Dynamic type system

Good performance, approaching that of statically-compiled languages like C

Built-in package manager

Lisp-like macros and other metaprogramming facilities

Call Python, R, or C functions directly

Powerful shell-like capabilities for managing other processes

Designed for parallelism and distributed computation

Coroutines: lightweight “green” threading

User-defined types are as fast and compact as built-ins

Automatic generation of efficient, specialized code for different argument types

Elegant and extensible conversions and promotions for numeric and other types

Efficient support for Unicode, including but not limited to UTF-8

Maybe?
